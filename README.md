Autohotkey script to toggle Japanese IME (Win10/Win11) on and off with a single `LShift` key.

## Overview
AutoHotKey (V2.0) script to toggle ON/OFF (Japanese/English) input with the Win10/Win11 new Japanese IME.
As the provided shortcut only allows `LCtrl + Space` and PowerToys' Keyboard Manager doesn't allow only using modifier keys as shortcuts,
I wrote this .ahk script to achieve the desired behavior.
Another reason would be that default Chinese IMEs all use `Shift` to toggle ON/OFF, so this feels much more natural to me.
Feel free to change the `LShift` to other modifiers or combinations.

## How to use
Press `Shift` to switch between English and Japanese (hiragana).

## Installation
Either install AutoHotKey V2 by yourself and then download the [.ahk file](https://github.com/HAL-lucination/ja-ime-ahk/blob/main/ja-ime.ahk) and double-click to run. 
Or directly go to the [Release](https://github.com/HAL-lucination/ja-ime-ahk/releases/tag/Release) to download 32-bit or 64-bit compiled execution files.
